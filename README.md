# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo contains a data processing script, 'run_analysis.R', a codebook, 'CodeBook.md', and the output table 'dataset.txt'.

The raw data was taken from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset and the processing script combines and tidies the data. The measurements were limited to the mean and standard deviation variables and the output table contains the averages of these variables for each activity for each subject. The codebook explains the variables and naming conventions.
